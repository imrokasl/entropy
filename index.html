    <p>128-bit entropy is the standard value for extreme overkill that's secure far into the future. It doesn't really
      make sense to generate a random passphrase with more than 128-bit entropy. The amount of entropy is a different
      thing from the size of the derived key encryption key. The useful reason for security levels above 128-bit is
      because algorithms get broken in ways that substantially reduce their security. 256-bit cipher which experiences a
      quite extreme break can still end up providing more than 128-bit security, thus still preserving indefinitely
      overkill security in practice. This is why using AES256 instead of AES128 makes sense, but generating a 256-bit
      entropy passphrase / seed phrase which just gets fed into a key derivation algorithm to derive arbitrary length
      keys really doesn't make sense.</p>
    <p>Significantly lower than 128-bit security is still considered secure and is just below the standard for extreme
      overkill that most people have settled on as making sense. Since passphrases go through key derivation adding a
      substantial work factor, passphrases with 90-bit entropy such as 7 diceword words or 18 lowercase letters/numbers
      are still highly secure and don't depend on hardware security features to prevent brute forcing. If you really
      want, you can raise that to 128-bit for extreme overkill but it is substantially more inconvenient and not really
      giving you real world benefits.</p>
